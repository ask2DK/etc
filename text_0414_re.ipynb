      "44text :  20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?It’s unfortunate that when something goes wrong, people obsess about why it happened, whose fault it was, and “why me?” Honestly, what good is that thinking in most cases? Train your brain to be solution­oriented. Let’s take the simplest example on the planet. What happens when a glass of milk spills? Yes, you can obsess and say, how did that fall, who made it fall, will it stain the floor, or think something along the lines of, “Why always me? I’m in a hurry and don’t need this.” But someone with a solution­oriented thought process would simply get a towel, pick up the glass, and get a new glass of milk. Use your energy wisely; learn from mistakes but then move on fast with solutions. ① 문제가 생기면 주위 사람들에게 조언을 구하라.② 비판하는 사람보다 격려하는 사람을 가까이하라.③ 실패의 경험을 분석해서 배우려는 자세를 가져라.④ 문제 자체에 집착하기보다는 문제 해결에 집중하라. ⑤ 예상치 못한 위험에 대비해 항상 경계를 늦추지 마라.\n",

They do what one would expect: they talk to people they already agree with, keep their mouths shut about important topics in mixed company, and often don’t bother even arguing with the angriest or loudest person in the room. The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn’t it? A good education ought to teach citizens to actively seek out the opinions of intelligent people with whom they disagree, in order to prevent the problem of “confirmation bias.” ① hear only the voices that strengthen their views② have mixed feelings towards the academic world③ find their followers from every corner of society④ be responsive to emotional cues from their peers⑤ blame educational systems for the social polarization\n",

They need to think about the military, a place where stress and uncertainty are the status quo, and where employees are on­boarded not with a beach vacation but with boot camp. And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet. That’s because after centuries of practice, the military has learned that if you go through stress with the right lens, and alongside others, you can create meaningful narratives and social bonds that you will talk about for the rest of your life. Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they are soldiers; every company and team can turn stress into wellsprings of potential.① 적절한 긴장감은 사고를 예방하는 데 도움이 된다.② 신속함보다는 정확한 업무 처리가 생산성을 개선한다.③ 목표 설정이 구체적일수록 성과를 빨리 달성할 수 있다.④ 인적 자원에 대한 투자는 조직에 대한 충성심을 높인다.⑤ 스트레스를 조직의 잠재력을 끌어낼 계기로 삼을 수 있다.\n",

When it strikes, it carries an author forward like the rushing torrents of a flooded river. And yet, if you wait for it, nothing happens. The irony is that so much is actually created ― mountains moved, sagas written, grand murals painted ― by those who might not even describe themselves as particularly inspired. Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner. This is the principle way writers finish 50,000 words of a novel each year during National Novel Writing Month ― by showing up ― and it applies to being creative the rest of the year as well.① crucial roles of persistent effort in creative writing② distinctive features of popular contemporary novels③ importance of detailed description in writing fiction④ revival of reading novels as a form of entertainment⑤ classical literature as a timeless source of inspiration\n",

By the time an idea makes it all the way up the chain, it will have been compared to all the other ideas in the system, with the obviously good ideas ranked at the top. This seems like common sense. The problem is that obviously good ideas are not truly innovative, and truly innovative ideas often look like very bad ideas when they’re introduced. Western Union famously passed on the opportunity to buy Alexander Graham Bell’s patents and technology for the telephone. At the time, phone calls were extremely noisy and easy to misinterpret, and they couldn’t span long distances, and Western Union knew from its telegram business that profitable communication depended on accuracy and widespread reach.

She graduated from medical school and completed an internship in surgery. But she soon found that her employment options were limited. Apgar tried something new, focusing her efforts on anesthesiology. After being denied several times, she was accepted into a training program in anesthesiology. As Apgar studied, she became interested in the way anesthesia given to mothers in labor affected babies. During this time, she developed the Apgar score, which is a method of checking the health of a newborn. According to the method, doctors must consider five different factors, including heart rate and breathing effort, when they inspect babies. She received many awards including an honorary doctorate from the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1964. In 1973, she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the Ladies Home Journal.① 의과 대학 졸업 후 외과에서 인턴 과정을 마쳤다.② 단번에 마취학 훈련 과정 입학을 허가받았다. ③ 산모 마취가 아기에게 미치는 영향에 관심을 가졌다.④ 신생아의 건강을 확인하는 방법을 개발했다.⑤ 명예박사 학위를 포함하여 많은 상을 받았다.\n",

Furthermore, by taking more and more readings, we obtain from the arithmetic mean a value which approaches more and more closely to the true value. Neither of these points is true for a systematic error. Repeated measurements with the same apparatus neither ② reveal nor do they eliminate a systematic error. For this reason systematic errors are potentially more ③ dangerous than random errors. If large random errors are present in an experiment, they will manifest themselves in a large value of the final quoted error.

      "22text :  31. A distinct emotional trait of human nature is to watch fellow humans closely, to learn their stories, and thereby to judge their character and dependability. And so it has ever been since the Pleistocene. The first bands classifiable to the genus Homo and their descendants were hunter­gatherers. Like the Kalahari Ju/’hoansi of today, they almost certainly depended on sophisticated cooperative behavior just to survive from one day to the next. That, in turn, required exact knowledge of the personal history and accomplishments of each of their groupmates, and equally they needed an empathetic sense of the feelings and propensities of others. It gives deep satisfaction — call it, if you will, a human instinct — not just to learn but also to share emotions stirred by the stories told by our companions. The whole of these performances pays off in survival and reproduction.          are Darwinian phenomena.① Gossip and storytelling② Planning and practicing③ Executing and revising④ Exhibition and jealousy⑤ Competitions and rewards\n",
      "44text :  32. Scaling up from the small to the large is often accompanied by an evolution from simplicity to complexity while                                   . This is familiar in engineering, economics, companies, cities, organisms, and, perhaps most dramatically, evolutionary process. For example, a skyscraper in a large city is a significantly more complex object than a modest family dwelling in a small town, but the underlying principles of construction and design, including questions of mechanics, energy and information distribution, the size of electrical outlets, water faucets, telephones, laptops, doors, etc., all remain approximately the same independent of the size of the building. Similarly, organisms have evolved to have an enormous range of sizes and an extraordinary diversity of morphologies and interactions, which often reflect increasing complexity, yet fundamental building blocks like cells, mitochondria, capillaries, and even leaves do not appreciably change with body size or increasing complexity of the class of systems in which they are embedded. ① maintaining basic elements unchanged or conserved② optimizing energy use for the structural growth③ assigning new functions to existing components④ incorporating foreign items from surroundings⑤ accelerating the elimination of useless parts \n",

Not knowing who wrote, or created, some artwork is often very frustrating. Our culture places great worth on the identity of speakers, writers, and artists. Perhaps the single most important aspect of “authorship” is the vaguely apprehended presence of human creativity, personality, and authority that nominal authorship seems to provide. It is almost unthinkable for a visitor to an art museum to admire a roomful of paintings without knowing the names of the individual painters, or for a reader not to know who the writer is of the novel she is reading. Publishers proudly display authors’ names on the jackets, spines and title pages of their books. Book advertisements in The New York Review of Books and The New York Times Book Review regularly include pictures of authors and quote authors as they talk about their work, both of which show that                               . ① book advertising strategies are being diversified② our interest is as much in authors as in their books③ authors are influenced by popular works of their time④ book cover designs show who their target readers are⑤ book writing is increasingly dictated by book marketing\n",
      "22text :  34. All athletes have an innate preference for task­ or ego­involved goals in sport. These predispositions, referred to as task and ego goal orientations, are believed to develop throughout childhood largely due to the types of people the athletes come in contact with and the situations they are placed in. If children consistently receive parental praise depending on their effort and recognition for personal improvement from their coaches, and are encouraged to learn from their mistakes, then they are likely to foster a task orientation. It becomes natural for them to believe that success is associated with mastery, effort, understanding, and personal responsibility. The behavior of their role models in sport also affects this development. Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non­selection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition. This kind of environment helps an ego orientation to flourish, along with the belief that                                    . ① not the result but the process is what matters most② an athlete’s abilities will blossom with image training③ cooperation, rather than competition, builds up a team④ ability and talent, not effort and personal endeavor, earn success⑤ the athletes’ peers, not the coaches, are the true judge of their performance\n",

Correcting the students requires a high level of sensitivity on the part of the teacher. It does not mean that there is no need to correct, but the correction should not lead to silencing the student. An authoritarian form of correction often prompts even the very brightest of students to withdraw from an uncomfortable situation, let alone those students who are less secure about their own intellectual potential. It also kills the willingness to entertain more risky interpretations. Instead of simply accepting any interpretation just for the sake of the freedom of expression, it is most advisable to question the student about how he/she arrived at their interpretation.

They do what one would expect: they talk to people they already agree with, keep their mouths shut about important topics in mixed company, and often don’t bother even arguing with the angriest or loudest person in the room. The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn’t it? A good education ought to teach citizens to actively seek out the opinions of intelligent people with whom they disagree, in order to prevent the problem of “confirmation bias.” ① hear only the voices that strengthen their views② have mixed feelings towards the academic world③ find their followers from every corner of society④ be responsive to emotional cues from their peers⑤ blame educational systems for the social polarization',\n",

And yet, the employees of the military remain among the highest functioning, steadfast, and loyal of virtually any organization on the planet.

Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they are soldiers; every company and team can turn stress into wellsprings of potential.① 적절한 긴장감은 사고를 예방하는 데 도움이 된다.② 신속함보다는 정확한 업무 처리가 생산성을 개선한다.③ 목표 설정이 구체적일수록 성과를 빨리 달성할 수 있다.④ 인적 자원에 대한 투자는 조직에 대한 충성심을 높인다.⑤ 스트레스를 조직의 잠재력을 끌어낼 계기로 삼을 수 있다.',\n",

And yet, if you wait for it, nothing happens. The irony is that so much is actually created ― mountains moved, sagas written, grand murals painted ― by those who might not even describe themselves as particularly inspired. Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter. “I write when the spirit moves me, and the spirit moves me every day,” said William Faulkner.

And so it has ever been since the Pleistocene. The first bands classifiable to the genus Homo and their descendants were hunter\\xadgatherers. Like the Kalahari Ju/’hoansi of today, they almost certainly depended on sophisticated cooperative behavior just to survive from one day to the next. That, in turn, required exact knowledge of the personal history and accomplishments of each of their groupmates, and equally they needed an empathetic sense of the feelings and propensities of others.

Not knowing who wrote, or created, some artwork is often very frustrating. Our culture places great worth on the identity of speakers, writers, and artists. Perhaps the single most important aspect of “authorship” is the vaguely apprehended presence of human creativity, personality, and authority that nominal authorship seems to provide. It is almost unthinkable for a visitor to an art museum to admire a roomful of paintings without knowing the names of the individual painters, or for a reader not to know who the writer is of the novel she is reading. Publishers proudly display authors’ names on the jackets, spines and title pages of their books. Book advertisements in The New York Review of Books and The New York Times Book Review regularly include pictures of authors and quote authors as they talk about their work, both of which show that                               . ① book advertising strategies are being diversified② our interest is as much in authors as in their books③ authors are influenced by popular works of their time④ book cover designs show who their target readers are⑤ book writing is increasingly dictated by book marketing',\n",
       " '34. All athletes have an innate preference for task\\xad or ego\\xadinvolved goals in sport. These predispositions, referred to as task and ego goal orientations, are believed to develop throughout childhood largely due to the types of people the athletes come in contact with and the situations they are placed in. If children consistently receive parental praise depending on their effort and recognition for personal improvement from their coaches, and are encouraged to learn from their mistakes, then they are likely to foster a task orientation. It becomes natural for them to believe that success is associated with mastery, effort, understanding, and personal responsibility. The behavior of their role models in sport also affects this development. Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non\\xadselection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition.

Scholars who emphasize the visual bias in Western culture even point to science as their favorite example. ( ① ) Because doing research seems impossible without using images, graphs, and diagrams, science is ― in their view ― a visual endeavor par excellence. ( ② ) They stress that scientific work involves more than visual observation.
