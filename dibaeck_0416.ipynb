Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves returning to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long‒term thinking is goal‒less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

Force your face to smile even when you are stressed or feel unhappy. The facial muscular pattern produced by the smile is linked to all the “happy networks” in your brain and will in turn naturally calm you down and change your brain chemistry by releasing the same feel‒good chemicals. Researchers studied the effects of a genuine and forced smile on individuals during a stressful event. The researchers had participants perform stressful tasks while not smiling, smiling, or holding chopsticks crossways in their mouths (to force the face to form a smile). The results of the study showed that smiling, forced or genuine, during stressful events reduced the intensity of the stress response in the body and lowered heart rate levels after recovering from the stress.① Causes and Effects of Stressful Events② Personal Signs and Patterns of Stress③ How Body and Brain React to Stress④ Stress: Necessary Evil for Happiness⑤ Do Faked Smiles Also Help Reduce Stress?'},\n",

Ask yourself: Were observations recorded during or after the experiment? Do the conclusions make sense? Can the results be repeated? Are the sources of information reliable? You should also ask if the scientist or group conducting the experiment was unbiased. Being unbiased means that you have no special interest in the outcome of the experiment. For example, if a drug company pays for an experiment to test how well one of its new products works, there is a special interest involved: The drug company profits if the experiment shows that its product is effective. Therefore, the experimenters aren’t                . They might ensure the conclusion is positive and benefits the drug company.

Chimps quickly overheat; humans do not, because they are much better at shedding body heat. According to one leading theory, ancestral humans lost their hair over successive generations because less hair meant cooler, more effective long‒distance running. That ability let our ancestors outmaneuver and outrun prey. Try wearing a couple of extra jackets — or better yet, fur coats — on a hot humid day and run a mile. Now, take those jackets off and try it again.

One of the main reasons that students may think they know the material, even when they don’t, is that they mistake familiarity for understanding. Here is how it works: You read the chapter once, perhaps highlighting as you go. Then later, you read the chapter again, perhaps focusing on the highlighted material. As you read it over, the material is familiar because you remember it from before, and this familiarity might lead you to think, “Okay, I know that.” The problem is that this feeling of familiarity is not necessarily equivalent to knowing the material and may be of no help when you have to come up with an answer on the exam. In fact, familiarity can often lead to errors on multiple‒choice exams because you might pick a choice that looks familiar, only to find later that it was something you had read, but                                                     . ① you couldn’t recall the parts you had highlighted② it wasn’t really the best answer to the question③ that familiarity was based on your understanding④ repetition enabled you to pick the correct answer⑤ it indicated that familiarity was naturally built up'},\n",

A poor coach will tell you what you did wrong and then tell you not to do it again: “Don’t drop the ball!” What happens next? The images you see in your head are images of you dropping the ball! Naturally, your mind recreates what it just “saw” based on what it’s been told. Not surprisingly, you walk on the court and drop the ball. What does the good coach do?
